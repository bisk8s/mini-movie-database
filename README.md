# Mini Movie Database
An app about movies.üçøüéûÔ∏èüé¨

## About
This is a shared Github repository for MMDB's back and frontend.
The backend of the project is deployed and running [online](https://mini-movie-database.herokuapp.com/movies)
To check the endpoints and documentation, keep scrolling. üôÇ
You will also find a link for the Expo Project and the APK next.

## Used libraries and frameworks
The backend of the project is an [AdonisJS](https://preview.adonisjs.com/blog/introducing-adonisjs-v5/) application.
AdonisJs is a Node.js MVC framework. It offers a stable ecosystem to write server-side web applications. And it also supports TypeScript.

When checking the Expo project you may also see that I've chosen to use [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/).
Paper is a collection of customizable and production-ready components, following Google‚Äôs Material Design guidelines. It adds a lot when the subject is style.
